Xcode extension that adds features perfected by TextMate

As a user of both TextMate and Xcode, I find myself missing features in Xcode.
It's easy to add features to TextMate, but not quite as easy with Xcode.

My plan here is to provide those missing editor features to Xcode where possible!

This is a working source editor extension, with one feature so far:

- [Duplicate Selection](https://github.com/RobinDaugherty/XcMate/wiki/Command%3A-Duplicate-Selection)
